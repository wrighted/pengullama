Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Complete the tokenized section, locate the error, and correct it.

### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to include: usb: include usb_ch9.h. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

#define ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_USB_HID_CLASS_DEVICE_H_

#include <zephyr/usb/class/hid.h>

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {

### Tokenized:

Here is the faulty code which has been tokenized:

begin_define
define|#
directive|define
name|ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_USB_HID_CLASS_DEVICE_H_
end_define
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/usb/class/hid.h>
end_include
begin_ifdef
ifdef|#
directive|ifdef
name|__cplusplus
end_ifdef
begin_block
block|{
end_block
begin_endif
endif|#
directive|endif
end_endif

### Error location:

I have identified the issue in the tokenized code. I have placed a <START_ERROR> before the problematic tokens and a <END_ERROR> after the problematic tokens:

begin_define
define|#
directive|define
name|ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_USB_HID_CLASS_DEVICE_H_
end_define
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/usb/class/hid.h>
<END_ERROR>
end_include
<START_ERROR>
begin_ifdef
ifdef|#
directive|ifdef
name|__cplusplus
end_ifdef
begin_block
block|{
end_block
begin_endif
endif|#
directive|endif
end_endif

### Error correction:

Here is the tokenized code with the issue corrected:

begin_define
define|#
directive|define
name|ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_USB_HID_CLASS_DEVICE_H_
end_define
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/usb/class/hid.h>
end_include
begin_include

end_include
begin_ifdef
ifdef|#
directive|ifdef
name|__cplusplus
end_ifdef
begin_block

end_block
begin_endif
endif|#
directive|endif
end_endif

### Response:

I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

#define ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_USB_HID_CLASS_DEVICE_H_

#include <zephyr/usb/class/hid.h>

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
The issue was with: include: usb: include usb_ch9.h

The usb_ch9.h header is required for the USB_HID_DEFINE_CLASS()
function. The header is required for the `struct usb_device_descriptor`
definition.. Here is the corrected version:

#define ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_USB_HID_CLASS_DEVICE_H_

#include <zephyr/usb/class/hid.h>
#include <zephyr/usb/class/usb_ch9.h>

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
