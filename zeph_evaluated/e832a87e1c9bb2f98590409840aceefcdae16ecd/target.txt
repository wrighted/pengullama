Original commit: https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/e832a87e1c9bb2f98590409840aceefcdae16ecd

### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to include: usb: include usb_ch9.h. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

#define ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_USB_HID_CLASS_DEVICE_H_

#include <zephyr/usb/class/hid.h>

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {

### Tokenized:
Here is the faulty code which has been tokenized:

begin_define
define|#
directive|define
name|ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_USB_HID_CLASS_DEVICE_H_
end_define
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/usb/class/hid.h>
end_include
begin_ifdef
ifdef|#
directive|ifdef
name|__cplusplus
end_ifdef
begin_extern
extern|extern
literal|"C"
block|{
end_extern

### Error location:
I have identified the issue in the tokenized code. I have placed a <START_ERROR> before the problematic tokens and a <END_ERROR> after the problematic tokens:

begin_define
define|#
directive|define
name|ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_USB_HID_CLASS_DEVICE_H_
end_define
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/usb/class/hid.h>
<END_ERROR>
end_include
<START_ERROR>
begin_ifdef
ifdef|#
directive|ifdef
name|__cplusplus
end_ifdef
begin_extern
extern|extern
literal|"C"
block|{
end_extern

### Error correction:
Here is the tokenized code with the issue corrected:

begin_define
define|#
directive|define
name|ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_USB_HID_CLASS_DEVICE_H_
end_define
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/usb/class/hid.h>
end_include
begin_include

end_include
begin_ifdef

end_ifdef
begin_extern

block|{
end_extern

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

#define ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_USB_HID_CLASS_DEVICE_H_

#include <zephyr/usb/class/hid.h>

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
The issue was with: include: usb: include usb_ch9.h

In usb_hid.h `struct usb_setup_packet` is used. This is defined in
usb_ch9.h but not included in usb_hid.h which leads to build errors when
you include the usb header files in the wrong order. This commit fixes
this behaviour.. Here is the corrected version:

#define ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_USB_HID_CLASS_DEVICE_H_

#include <zephyr/usb/class/hid.h>
#include <zephyr/usb/usb_ch9.h>

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
