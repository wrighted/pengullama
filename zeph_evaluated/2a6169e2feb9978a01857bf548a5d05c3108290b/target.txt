### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to Bluetooth: Controller: Fix coverity issue 340852. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:


	cte_info.type = df_cfg->cte_type;
	cte_info.time = df_cfg->cte_length;

	/* Note: ULL_ADV_PDU_EXTRA_DATA_ALLOC_ALWAYS is just information that extra_data
	 * is required in case of this ull_adv_sync_pdu_alloc.

### Tokenized:
Here is the faulty code which has been tokenized:

begin_expr_stmt
name|cte_info
operator|.
name|type
operator|=
name|df_cfg
operator|->
name|cte_type
expr_stmt|;
end_expr_stmt
begin_expr_stmt
name|cte_info
operator|.
name|time
operator|=
name|df_cfg
operator|->
name|cte_length
expr_stmt|;
end_expr_stmt
begin_comment
comment|/*
end_comment

### Error location:
I have identified the issue in the tokenized code. I have placed a <START_ERROR> before the problematic tokens and a <END_ERROR> after the problematic tokens:

begin_expr_stmt
name|cte_info
operator|.
name|type
operator|=
name|df_cfg
operator|->
name|cte_type
expr_stmt|;
end_expr_stmt
begin_expr_stmt
name|cte_info
operator|.
name|time
operator|=
name|df_cfg
operator|->
name|cte_length
<END_ERROR>
expr_stmt|;
end_expr_stmt
<START_ERROR>
begin_comment
comment|/*
end_comment

### Error correction:
Here is the tokenized code with the issue corrected:

begin_expr_stmt
name|cte_info
operator|.
name|type
operator|=
name|df_cfg
operator|->
name|cte_type
expr_stmt|;
end_expr_stmt
begin_expr_stmt
name|cte_info
operator|.
name|time
operator|=
name|df_cfg
operator|->
name|cte_length
expr_stmt|;
end_expr_stmt
begin_expr_stmt
name|cte_info
operator|.
name|rfu
operator|=
literal|0U
expr_stmt|;
end_expr_stmt
begin_comment

end_comment

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:


	cte_info.type = df_cfg->cte_type;
	cte_info.time = df_cfg->cte_length;

	/* Note: ULL_ADV_PDU_EXTRA_DATA_ALLOC_ALWAYS is just information that extra_data
	 * is required in case of this ull_adv_sync_pdu_alloc.
The issue was with: Bluetooth: Controller: Fix coverity issue 340852

Fix coverity issue 340852, Uninitialized scalar variable.. Here is the corrected version:


	cte_info.type = df_cfg->cte_type;
	cte_info.time = df_cfg->cte_length;
	cte_info.rfu = 0U;

	/* Note: ULL_ADV_PDU_EXTRA_DATA_ALLOC_ALWAYS is just information that extra_data
	 * is required in case of this ull_adv_sync_pdu_alloc.
