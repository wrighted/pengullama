Functionally the same, but more complicated.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Complete the tokenized section, locate the error, and correct it.

### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to drivers: stm32-rtc: return -ENODATA when RTC is uninitialized. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

		return err;
	}

	do {
		/* read date, time and subseconds and relaunch if a day increment occurred
		 * while doing so as it will result in an erroneous result otherwise

### Tokenized:

Here is the faulty code which has been tokenized:

begin_return
return|return
name|err
return|;
end_return
begin_expr_stmt
unit|}
operator|(
operator|/
comment|/*
operator|/
name|RTC_Date
operator|,
name|RTC_Time
operator|,
name|RTC_SubSec
operator|)
expr_stmt|;
end_expr_stmt
begin_comment
comment|/*
end_comment

### Error location:
I have identified the issue in the tokenized code. I have placed a <START_ERROR> before the problematic tokens and a <END_ERROR> after the problematic tokens:

begin_return
return|return
name|err
return|;
end_return
begin_expr_stmt
unit|}
operator|(
operator|/
comment|/*
operator|/
name|RTC_Date
operator|,
name|RTC_Time
operator|,
name|RTC_SubSec
operator|)
expr_stmt|;
end_expr_stmt
<START_ERROR>
begin_comment
comment|/*
end_comment
<END_ERROR>

### Error correction:
Here is the tokenized code with the issue corrected:

begin_return
return|return
name|err
return|;
end_return
begin_expr_stmt
unit|}
operator|(
operator|/
comment|/*

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

		return err;
	}

	do {
		/* read date, time and subseconds and relaunch if a day increment occurred
		 * while doing so as it will result in an erroneous result otherwise
The issue was with: drivers: stm32-rtc: return -ENODATA when RTC is uninitialized

The STM32 RTC driver will return an error when the RTC is not
initialized. The error code is not propagated to the caller and
this may result in an unexpected behavior.

This commit changes the driver to return -ENODATA when the RTC is
not initialized.. Here is the corrected version:

		return err;
	}

	if (RTC_Date.flags == RTC_FLAG_DATE_UNINITIALIZED ||
	    RTC_Time.flags == RTC_FLAG_TIME_UNINITIALIZED ||
	    RTC_SubSec.flags == RTC_FLAG_SUBSECONDS_UNINITIALIZED) {
		return -ENODATA;
	}

	do {
		/* read date, time and subseconds and relaunch if a day increment occurred
		 * while doing so as it will result in an erroneous result otherwise
