Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Complete the tokenized section, locate the error, and correct it.

### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to net: lib: sntp: add support for unspecified IP-family type. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

	uint64_t deadline;
	uint32_t iter_timeout;

	hints.ai_family = AF_INET;
	hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_DGRAM;
	hints.ai_protocol = 0;
	/* 123 is the standard SNTP port per RFC4330 */

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided. The issue was with: net: lib: sntp: add support for unspecified IP-family type

The unspecified IP-family type is used when a client does not care about the
IP-family type of the server.. Here is the corrected version:

	uint64_t deadline;
	uint32_t iter_timeout;

	hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;
	hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_DGRAM;
	hints.ai_protocol = 0;
	/* 123 is the standard SNTP port per RFC4330 */
