Added an include, but not the right one.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Complete the tokenized section, locate the error, and correct it.

### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to sys: atomic_c: skip syscall tracing. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

#endif

#ifdef CONFIG_ATOMIC_OPERATIONS_C
#include <syscalls/atomic_c.h>
#endif

#endif /* ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_SYS_ATOMIC_C_H_ */

### Error location:
I have identified the issue in the code you provided. I have placed a <START_ERROR> before the problematic code and a <END_ERROR> after the problematic code.

### Error correction:
Here is the code with the issue corrected:

#endif

#ifdef CONFIG_ATOMIC_OPERATIONS_C
#include <syscalls/atomic_c.h>
#endif

#endif /* ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_SYS_ATOMIC_C_H_ */

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided. The issue was with: sys: atomic_c: skip syscall tracing

This fixes a compile error when CONFIG_TRACING is not enabled.
Here is the corrected version:

#endif

#ifdef CONFIG_ATOMIC_OPERATIONS_C
#include <syscalls/atomic_c.h>
#endif

#ifdef CONFIG_TRACING
#include <zephyr/sys/syscall.h>
#endif

#endif /* ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_SYS_ATOMIC_C_H_ */
