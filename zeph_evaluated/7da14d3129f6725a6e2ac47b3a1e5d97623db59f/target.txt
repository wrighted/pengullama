Original commit: https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/7da14d3129f6725a6e2ac47b3a1e5d97623db59f

### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to net: shell: Clarify the name of the virtual interface. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

			name = "<unknown>";
		}

		PR("Name      : %s\n", name);

		orig_iface = net_virtual_get_iface(iface);
		if (orig_iface == NULL) {

### Tokenized:
Here is the faulty code which has been tokenized:

begin_expr_stmt
name|name
operator|=
literal|"<unknown>"
expr_stmt|;
end_expr_stmt
begin_expr_stmt
unit|}
operator|(
literal|"Name
operator|,
name|name
operator|)
expr_stmt|;
end_expr_stmt
begin_expr_stmt
name|orig_iface
operator|=
name|net_virtual_get_iface
argument_list|(
name|iface
argument_list|)
expr_stmt|;
end_expr_stmt
begin_if_stmt
if|if
condition|(
name|orig_iface
operator|==
name|NULL
condition|)
block|{
end_if_stmt

### Error location:
I have identified the issue in the tokenized code. I have placed a <START_ERROR> before the problematic tokens and a <END_ERROR> after the problematic tokens:

begin_expr_stmt
name|name
operator|=
literal|"<unknown>"
expr_stmt|;
end_expr_stmt
begin_expr_stmt
unit|}
operator|(
<START_ERROR>
literal|"Name
<END_ERROR>
operator|,
name|name
operator|)
expr_stmt|;
end_expr_stmt
begin_expr_stmt
name|orig_iface
operator|=
name|net_virtual_get_iface
argument_list|(
name|iface
argument_list|)
expr_stmt|;
end_expr_stmt
begin_if_stmt
if|if
condition|(
name|orig_iface
operator|==
name|NULL
condition|)
block|{
end_if_stmt

### Error correction:
Here is the tokenized code with the issue corrected:

begin_expr_stmt
name|name
operator|=
literal|"<unknown>"
expr_stmt|;
end_expr_stmt
begin_expr_stmt
unit|}
operator|(
literal|"Virtual
operator|,
name|name
operator|)
expr_stmt|;
end_expr_stmt
begin_expr_stmt
name|orig_iface
operator|=
name|net_virtual_get_iface
argument_list|(
name|iface
argument_list|)
expr_stmt|;
end_expr_stmt
begin_if_stmt
if|if
condition|(
name|orig_iface
operator|==
name|NULL
condition|)
block|{
end_if_stmt

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

			name = "<unknown>";
		}

		PR("Name      : %s\n", name);

		orig_iface = net_virtual_get_iface(iface);
		if (orig_iface == NULL) {
The issue was with: net: shell: Clarify the name of the virtual interface

The net-shell printed virtual interface name so that it got
the impression it was the network interface name which is not
correct. Now the name is printed as "Virtual name" which is
unambiguous.. Here is the corrected version:

			name = "<unknown>";
		}

		PR("Virtual name : %s\n", name);

		orig_iface = net_virtual_get_iface(iface);
		if (orig_iface == NULL) {
