 */
#define PINCTRL_DT_STATE_INIT(prop, state)				       \
	{								       \
		.id = state,						       \
		.pins = prop ## _pins,					       \
		.pin_cnt = ARRAY_SIZE(prop ## _pins)			       \
	}

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

#define PINCTRL_DT_STATE_INIT(prop, state)				       \
	{								       \
		.id = state,						       \
		.pins = prop ## _pins,					       \
		.pin_cnt = ARRAY_SIZE(prop ## _pins)			       \
	}

/**
The issue was with: drivers/pinctrl.h: Resolve PINCTRL_DT_STATE_INIT Cpp Compatibility

The Cpp compatibility issue with PINCTRL_DT_STATE_INIT was resolved
by adding the missing comma.. Here is the corrected version:

 */
#define PINCTRL_DT_STATE_INIT(prop, state)				       \
	{								       \
		.id = state,						       \
		.pins = prop ## _pins,					       \
		.pin_cnt = ARRAY_SIZE(prop ## _pins),		       \
	}
