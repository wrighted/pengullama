### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to drivers/pinctrl.h: Resolve PINCTRL_DT_STATE_INIT Cpp Compatibility. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

 */
#define PINCTRL_DT_STATE_INIT(prop, state)				       \
	{								       \
		.id = state,						       \
		.pins = prop ## _pins,					       \
		.pin_cnt = ARRAY_SIZE(prop ## _pins)			       \
	}

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

 */
#define PINCTRL_DT_STATE_INIT(prop, state)				       \
	{								       \
		.id = state,						       \
		.pins = prop ## _pins,					       \
		.pin_cnt = ARRAY_SIZE(prop ## _pins)			       \
	}

/**
The issue was with: drivers/pinctrl.h: Resolve PINCTRL_DT_STATE_INIT Cpp Compatibility

This commit adds C++20 onwards support for the
PINCTRL_DT_STATE_INIT macro. Since C++20, support was
added for designated initializers but with the restriction that
they're ordered. PINCTRL_DT_STATE_INIT initializes a
pinctrl_state struct but the current initializer list is un-ordered,
this PR resolves that for >= C++20 compat. Here is the corrected version:

 */
#define PINCTRL_DT_STATE_INIT(prop, state)				       \
	{								       \
		.pins = prop ## _pins,					       \
		.pin_cnt = ARRAY_SIZE(prop ## _pins),			       \
		.id = state						       \
	}
