While this was an attempt at the same goal, this is not the same fix.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Complete the tokenized section, locate the error, and correct it.

### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to soc: mcxc: Enable bandgap buffer for on die temperature measurement. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:


void soc_early_init_hook(void)
{
	clock_init();
}


### Tokenized:

Here is the faulty code which has been tokenized:

begin_function
name|void
name|soc_early_init_hook
parameter_list|(
name|void
parameter_list|)
block|{
name|clock_init
argument_list|()
expr_stmt|;
block|}
end_function

### Error location:
I have identified the issue in the tokenized code. I have placed a <START_ERROR> before the problematic tokens and a <END_ERROR> after the problematic tokens:

begin_function
name|void
name|soc_early_init_hook
parameter_list|(
name|void
parameter_list|)
block|{
<START_ERROR>
name|clock_init
argument_list|()
expr_stmt|;
<END_ERROR>
block|}
end_function

### Error correction:
Here is the tokenized code with the issue corrected:

begin_function
name|void
name|soc_early_init_hook
parameter_list|(
name|void
parameter_list|)
block|{
name|clock_init
argument_list|()
expr_stmt|;
name|pm_scb_bgb_en_set
argument_list|(
literal|1
argument_list|)
expr_stmt|;
block|}
end_function

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:


void soc_early_init_hook(void)
{
	clock_init();
}

The issue was with: soc: mcxc: Enable bandgap buffer for on die temperature measurement

On MCXC, bandgap buffer is disabled by default. This change enables it
to allow on die temperature measurement.. Here is the corrected version:


void soc_early_init_hook(void)
{
	clock_init();

	pm_scb_bgb_en_set(1);
}
