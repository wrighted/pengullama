### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to drivers: tmag5273: fix documentation of tmag5273_check_device_status. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

/**
 * @brief checks for DIAG_FAIL errors and reads out the DEVICE_STATUS register if necessary
 *
* Prints a human readable representation to the log, if \c CONFIG_LOG is activated.
*
* @param drv_cfg[in] driver instance configuration
* @param device_status[out] DEVICE_STATUS register if DIAG_FAIL is set
 *
 * @retval 0 on success
* @retval "!= 0" on error (see @ref i2c_reg_read_byte for error codes)
 *
 * @note
* If tmag5273_config.ignore_diag_fail is se
*   -  \a device_status will be always set to \c 0,
 *   - the function always returns \c 0.
 */
