Did not locate and error, fix is incorrect.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Complete the tokenized section, locate the error, and correct it.

### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to kernel: timeout: fix issue with z_timeout_expires. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

	k_ticks_t ticks = 0;

	K_SPINLOCK(&timeout_lock) {
		ticks = curr_tick + timeout_rem(timeout);
	}

	return ticks;

### Tokenized:

begin_decl_stmt
name|k_ticks_t
name|ticks
init|=
literal|0
decl_stmt|;
end_decl_stmt
begin_block
block|{
name|K_SPINLOCK
argument_list|(
operator|&
name|timeout_lock

block|{
name|ticks

name|timeout_rem
argument_list|(
name|timeout
argument_list|)
expr_stmt|;
block|}
end_block
begin_return

name|ticks
return|;
end_return

### Error location:
I have identified the issue in the code you provided. I have placed a <START_ERROR> before the problematic code and a <END_ERROR> after the problematic code.

### Error correction:
Here is the tokenized code with the issue corrected:

begin_decl_stmt
name|k_ticks_t
name|ticks
init|=
literal|0
decl_stmt|;
end_decl_stmt
begin_block
block|{
name|K_SPINLOCK
argument_list|(
operator|&
name|timeout_lock
argument_list|)
block|{
name|ticks
operator|=
name|curr_tick
operator|+
name|timeout_rem
argument_list|(
name|timeout
argument_list|)
expr_stmt|;
block|}
end_block
begin_return
return|return
name|ticks
return|;
end_return

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided. The issue was with: kernel: timeout: fix issue with z_timeout_expires

The z_timeout_expires() function was returning the current tick
value plus the timeout, which was incorrect. This commit fixes
the issue by returning the current tick value minus the timeout.. Here is the corrected version:

	k_ticks_t ticks = 0;

	K_SPINLOCK(&timeout_lock) {
		ticks = curr_tick - timeout_rem(timeout);
	}

	return ticks;
