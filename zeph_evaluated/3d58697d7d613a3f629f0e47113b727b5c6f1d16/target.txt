Original commit: https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/3d58697d7d613a3f629f0e47113b727b5c6f1d16

### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to drivers: phy_mii: Remove the unneeded header file. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

#include <zephyr/device.h>
#include <zephyr/init.h>
#include <zephyr/kernel.h>
#include <soc.h>
#include <zephyr/drivers/mdio.h>
#include <zephyr/net/phy.h>
#include <zephyr/net/mii.h>

### Tokenized:
Here is the faulty code which has been tokenized:

begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/device.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/init.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/kernel.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<soc.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/drivers/mdio.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/net/phy.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/net/mii.h>
end_include

### Error location:
I have identified the issue in the tokenized code. I have placed a <START_ERROR> before the problematic tokens and a <END_ERROR> after the problematic tokens:

begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/device.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/init.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/kernel.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
<START_ERROR>
file|<soc.h>
<END_ERROR>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/drivers/mdio.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/net/phy.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/net/mii.h>
end_include

### Error correction:
Here is the tokenized code with the issue corrected:

begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/device.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/init.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/kernel.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/drivers/mdio.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/net/phy.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/net/mii.h>
end_include

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

#include <zephyr/device.h>
#include <zephyr/init.h>
#include <zephyr/kernel.h>
#include <soc.h>
#include <zephyr/drivers/mdio.h>
#include <zephyr/net/phy.h>
#include <zephyr/net/mii.h>
The issue was with: drivers: phy_mii: Remove the unneeded header file

Remove the 'soc.h' to fix the compiling error as the 'phy_mii.c'
doesn't need it.. Here is the corrected version:

#include <zephyr/device.h>
#include <zephyr/init.h>
#include <zephyr/kernel.h>
#include <zephyr/drivers/mdio.h>
#include <zephyr/net/phy.h>
#include <zephyr/net/mii.h>
