Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Complete the tokenized section, locate the error, and correct it.

### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to tests: drivers: can: api: Add negative test for can_add_rx_filter(). Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

	can_remove_rx_filter(can_dev, filter_id);
}

/**
 * @brief Test adding an invalid CAN RX filter.
 *

### Tokenized:

Here is the faulty code which has been tokenized:

begin_expr_stmt
name|can_remove_rx_filter
argument_list|(
name|can_dev
argument_list|,
name|filter_id
argument_list|)
expr_stmt|;
end_expr_stmt
begin_comment
unit|}
comment|/**
end_comment

### Error location:
I have identified the issue in the tokenized code. I have placed a <START_ERROR> before the problematic tokens and a <END_ERROR> after the problematic tokens:

begin_expr_stmt
name|can_remove_rx_filter
argument_list|(
name|can_dev
argument_list|,
name|filter_id
argument_list|)
expr_stmt|;
end_expr_stmt
begin_comment
<END_ERROR>
<START_ERROR>
unit|}
comment|/**
end_comment

### Error correction:
Here is the tokenized code with the issue corrected:

begin_expr_stmt
name|can_remove_rx_filter
argument_list|(
name|can_dev
argument_list|,
name|filter_id
argument_list|)
expr_stmt|;
end_expr_stmt
begin_comment
comment|/**
end_comment

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

	can_remove_rx_filter(can_dev, filter_id);
}

/**
 * @brief Test adding an invalid CAN RX filter.
 *
The issue was with: tests: drivers: can: api: Add negative test for can_add_rx_filter()

can_add_rx_filter() should return -EINVAL if the ID mask is invalid.
This test verifies that can_add_rx_filter() returns -EINVAL if the ID mask
is invalid.. Here is the corrected version:

	can_remove_rx_filter(can_dev, filter_id);
}

/**

 * can_add_rx_filter() should return -EINVAL if the ID mask is invalid.
