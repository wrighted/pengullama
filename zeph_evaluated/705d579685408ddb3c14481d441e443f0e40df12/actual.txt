I am having trouble with the following code in relation to drivers: dma: dma_nxp_edma: allow channel re-configuration. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

		}
		break;
	case CHAN_STATE_CONFIGURED:
		if (next!= CHAN_STATE_STARTED) {
			return -EPERM;
		}
		break;

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

		}
		break;
	case CHAN_STATE_CONFIGURED:
		if (next!= CHAN_STATE_STARTED) {
			return -EPERM;
		}
		break;
The issue was with: drivers: dma: dma_nxp_edma: allow channel re-configuration

Currently, the DMA channel can be configured only once, but there is no
reason why it should not be allowed to reconfigure the channel if it is
not started. This patch allows reconfiguration of the channel if it is
not started.. Here is the corrected version:

		}
		break;
	case CHAN_STATE_CONFIGURED:
		if (next!= CHAN_STATE_STARTED) {
			/* allow reconfiguration of the channel */
			return 0;
		}
		break;
