Original commit: https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/705d579685408ddb3c14481d441e443f0e40df12

### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to drivers: dma: dma_nxp_edma: allow channel re-configuration. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

		}
		break;
	case CHAN_STATE_CONFIGURED:
		if (next != CHAN_STATE_STARTED) {
			return -EPERM;
		}
		break;

### Tokenized:
Here is the faulty code which has been tokenized:

begin_empty_stmt
unit|}
empty_stmt|;
end_empty_stmt
begin_case
case|case
name|CHAN_STATE_CONFIGURED
case|:
end_case
begin_if_stmt
if|if
condition|(
name|next
operator|!=
name|CHAN_STATE_STARTED
condition|)
block|{
return|return
operator|-
name|EPERM
return|;
block|}
end_if_stmt
begin_break
break|break;
end_break

### Error location:
I have identified the issue in the tokenized code. I have placed a <START_ERROR> before the problematic tokens and a <END_ERROR> after the problematic tokens:

begin_empty_stmt
unit|}
empty_stmt|;
end_empty_stmt
begin_case
case|case
name|CHAN_STATE_CONFIGURED
case|:
end_case
begin_if_stmt
if|if
condition|(
name|next
operator|!=
name|CHAN_STATE_STARTED
<END_ERROR>
<START_ERROR>
condition|)
block|{
return|return
operator|-
name|EPERM
return|;
block|}
end_if_stmt
begin_break
break|break;
end_break

### Error correction:
Here is the tokenized code with the issue corrected:

begin_empty_stmt
unit|}
empty_stmt|;
end_empty_stmt
begin_case
case|case
name|CHAN_STATE_CONFIGURED
case|:
end_case
begin_if_stmt
if|if
condition|(
name|next
operator|!=
name|CHAN_STATE_STARTED
operator|&&
name|next
operator|!=
name|CHAN_STATE_CONFIGURED
condition|)
block|{
return|return
operator|-
name|EPERM
return|;
block|}
end_if_stmt
begin_break
break|break;
end_break

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

		}
		break;
	case CHAN_STATE_CONFIGURED:
		if (next != CHAN_STATE_STARTED) {
			return -EPERM;
		}
		break;
The issue was with: drivers: dma: dma_nxp_edma: allow channel re-configuration

Currently, the state transition function doesn't allow
the re-configuration of an already configured channel
(i.e: CHAN_CONFIGURED -> CHAN_CONFIGURED transition). This
causes problems when using `pulseaudio` and `SOF` because
the same channel ends up being configured multiple times
in the beginning due to how pulse seems to work. Logically
speaking, re-configuring an already configured channel is
not wrong so this commit solves the issue by allowing
the CHAN_CONFIGURED -> CHAN_CONFIGURED transition.. Here is the corrected version:

		}
		break;
	case CHAN_STATE_CONFIGURED:
		if (next != CHAN_STATE_STARTED &&
		    next != CHAN_STATE_CONFIGURED) {
			return -EPERM;
		}
		break;
