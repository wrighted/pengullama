Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Complete the tokenized section, locate the error, and correct it.

### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to include: net_if: Fix IPV6 prefix struct doc desc. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

/**
 * @brief Network Interface IPv6 prefixes
 *
* Stores the multicast IP addresses assigned to this network interface.
 */
struct net_if_ipv6_prefix {
	/** Prefix lifetime */

### Tokenized:

Here is the faulty code which has been tokenized:

begin_comment
comment|/**
end_comment
begin_struct
struct|struct
name|net_if_ipv6_prefix
block|{
end_struct
begin_comment
comment|/**
end_comment

### Error location:
I have identified the issue in the tokenized code. I have placed a <START_ERROR> before the problematic tokens and a <END_ERROR> after the problematic tokens:

begin_comment
<END_ERROR>
comment|/**
end_comment
begin_struct
struct|struct
name|net_if_ipv6_prefix
block|{
end_struct
begin_comment
comment|/**
end_comment

### Error correction:
Here is the tokenized code with the issue corrected:

begin_comment
comment|/**
end_comment
begin_struct
struct|struct
name|net_if_ipv6_prefix
block|{
end_struct
begin_comment
comment|/**
end_comment

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

/**
 * @brief Network Interface IPv6 prefixes
 *
* Stores the multicast IP addresses assigned to this network interface.
 */
struct net_if_ipv6_prefix {
	/** Prefix lifetime */
The issue was with: include: net_if: Fix IPV6 prefix struct doc desc

This fixes a typo in the net_if_ipv6_prefix struct doc description.. Here is the corrected version:

/**
 * @brief Network Interface IPv6 prefixes
 *
* Stores the multicast IPv6 prefixes assigned to this network interface.
 */
struct net_if_ipv6_prefix {
	/** Prefix lifetime */
