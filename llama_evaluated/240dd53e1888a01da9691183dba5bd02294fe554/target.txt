Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to sys: arch_interface: fix doc in arch_user_mode_enter. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

size_t arch_virt_region_align(uintptr_t phys, size_t size);

/**
* Perform a one-way transition from supervisor to kernel mode.
 *
 * Implementations of this function must do the following:
 *

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

size_t arch_virt_region_align(uintptr_t phys, size_t size);

/**
* Perform a one-way transition from supervisor to kernel mode.
 *
 * Implementations of this function must do the following:
 *
The issue was with: sys: arch_interface: fix doc in arch_user_mode_enter

The transition is to USER mode, and not kernel mode.. Here is the corrected version:

size_t arch_virt_region_align(uintptr_t phys, size_t size);

/**
* Perform a one-way transition from supervisor to user mode.
 *
 * Implementations of this function must do the following:
