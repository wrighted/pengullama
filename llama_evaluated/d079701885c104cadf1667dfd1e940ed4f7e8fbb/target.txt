Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to tracing: segger-sysview: fix compilation error. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

	SEGGER_SYSVIEW_RecordEndCallU32(TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT,	       \
					(uint32_t)ret)
#define sys_port_trace_pm_device_runtime_put_async_enter(dev, delay)	       \
	SEGGER_SYSVIEW_RecordU32(TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT_ASYNC,	       \
			 (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)dev, (uint32_t)delay.ticks)
#define sys_port_trace_pm_device_runtime_put_async_exit(dev, delay, ret)       \
	SEGGER_SYSVIEW_RecordEndCallU32(TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT_ASYNC,       \

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

	SEGGER_SYSVIEW_RecordEndCallU32(TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT,	       \
					(uint32_t)ret)
#define sys_port_trace_pm_device_runtime_put_async_enter(dev, delay)	       \
	SEGGER_SYSVIEW_RecordU32(TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT_ASYNC,	       \
			 (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)dev, (uint32_t)delay.ticks)
#define sys_port_trace_pm_device_runtime_put_async_exit(dev, delay, ret)       \
	SEGGER_SYSVIEW_RecordEndCallU32(TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT_ASYNC,       \
The issue was with: tracing: segger-sysview: fix compilation error

SEGGER_SYSVIEW_RecordU32 function takes only two parameters,
SEGGER_SYSVIEW_RecordU32x2 should be used instead.. Here is the corrected version:

	SEGGER_SYSVIEW_RecordEndCallU32(TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT,	       \
					(uint32_t)ret)
#define sys_port_trace_pm_device_runtime_put_async_enter(dev, delay)	       \
	SEGGER_SYSVIEW_RecordU32x2(TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT_ASYNC,	       \
			 (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)dev, (uint32_t)delay.ticks)
#define sys_port_trace_pm_device_runtime_put_async_exit(dev, delay, ret)       \
	SEGGER_SYSVIEW_RecordEndCallU32(TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT_ASYNC,       \
