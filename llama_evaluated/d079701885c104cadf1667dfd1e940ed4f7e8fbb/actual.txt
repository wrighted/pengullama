Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to tracing: segger-sysview: fix compilation error. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

	SEGGER_SYSVIEW_RecordEndCallU32(TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT,	       \
					(uint32_t)ret)
#define sys_port_trace_pm_device_runtime_put_async_enter(dev, delay)	       \
	SEGGER_SYSVIEW_RecordU32(TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT_ASYNC,	       \
			 (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)dev, (uint32_t)delay.ticks)
#define sys_port_trace_pm_device_runtime_put_async_exit(dev, delay, ret)       \
	SEGGER_SYSVIEW_RecordEndCallU32(TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT_ASYNC,       \

### Response:
This code has some errors in it. The first error is the use of the SEGGER_SYSVIEW_RecordEndCallU32 function. This function is used to record the end of a call to a function, but the arguments passed to it are incorrect. The first argument should be the ID of the function being called, but in this case it is the ID of the TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT_ASYNC function. The second argument should be the return value of the function being called, but in this case it is the ID of the TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT_ASYNC function. The third argument should be the ID of the function being called, but in this case it is the ID of the TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT_ASYNC function. The fourth argument should be the return value of the function being called, but in this case it is the ID of the TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT_ASYNC function.

The second error is the use of the SEGGER_SYSVIEW_RecordU32 function. This function is used to record a value of type uint32_t, but in this case the arguments passed to it are incorrect. The first argument should be the ID of the TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT_ASYNC function, but in this case it is the ID of the TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT function. The second argument should be the value to be recorded, but in this case it is the ID of the TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT function. The third argument should be the ID of the TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT function, but in this case it is the ID of the TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT_ASYNC function. The fourth argument should be the value to be recorded, but in this case it is the ID of the TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT_ASYNC function.

The third error is the use of the SEGGER_SYSVIEW_RecordEndCallU32 function. This function is used to record the end of a call to a function, but the arguments passed to it are incorrect. The first argument should be the ID of the TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT_ASYNC function, but in this case it is the ID of the TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT function. The second argument should be the return value of the function being called, but in this case it is the ID of the TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT function. The third argument should be the ID of the TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT function, but in this case it is the ID of the TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT_ASYNC function. The fourth argument should be the return value of the function being called, but in this case it is the ID of the TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT_ASYNC function.

To fix these errors, the following changes should be made:

1. In the definition of the sys_port_trace_pm_device_runtime_put_async_enter function, the first argument should be the ID of the TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT_ASYNC function, and the second argument should be the return value of the function being called.
2. In the definition of the sys_port_trace_pm_device_runtime_put_async_exit function, the first argument should be the ID of the TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT_ASYNC function, and the second argument should be the return value of the function being called.
3. In the definition of the sys_port_trace_pm_device_runtime_put_async_enter function, the first argument should be the ID of the TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT function, and the second argument should be the value to be recorded.
4. In the definition of the sys_port_trace_pm_device_runtime_put_async_exit function, the first argument should be the ID of the TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT function, and the second argument should be the value to be recorded.
5. In the definition of the sys_port_trace_pm_device_runtime_put_async_enter function, the first argument should be the ID of the TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT_ASYNC function, and the second argument should be the return value of the function being called.
6. In the definition of the sys_port_trace_pm_device_runtime_put_async_exit function, the first argument should be the ID of the TID_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME_PUT_ASYNC function, and the second argument should be the return value of the function being called.

These changes should fix the errors in the code.
