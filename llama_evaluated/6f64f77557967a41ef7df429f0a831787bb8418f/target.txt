Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to Bluetooth: Controller: Remove incorrect check of RFU bit. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:


	h = (void *)p->ext_hdr_adv_data;

	/* Regard PDU as invalid if a RFU field is set, we do not know the
	 * size of this future field, hence will cause incorrect calculation of
	 * offset to ACAD field.
	 */
	if (h->rfu) {
		goto ull_scan_aux_rx_flush;
	}

	ptr = h->data;


### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:


	h = (void *)p->ext_hdr_adv_data;

	/* Regard PDU as invalid if a RFU field is set, we do not know the
	 * size of this future field, hence will cause incorrect calculation of
	 * offset to ACAD field.
	 */
	if (h->rfu) {
		goto ull_scan_aux_rx_flush;
	}

	ptr = h->data;

The issue was with: Bluetooth: Controller: Remove incorrect check of RFU bit

RFU bits has to be ignored according to the spec; In addition,
some MediaTek devices seems to have it set (by mistake I assume),
so having the check means we cannot sync to these devices. Here is the corrected version:


	h = (void *)p->ext_hdr_adv_data;

	/* Note: The extended header contains a RFU flag that could potentially cause incorrect
	 * calculation of offset to ACAD field if it gets used to add a new header field; However,
	 * from discussion in BT errata ES-8080 it seems clear that BT SIG is aware that the RFU
	 * bit can not be used to add a new field since existing implementations will not be able
	 * to calculate the start of ACAD in that case
	 */

	ptr = h->data;
