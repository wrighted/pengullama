Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to Bluetooth: Controller: Remove incorrect check of RFU bit. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:


	h = (void *)p->ext_hdr_adv_data;

	/* Regard PDU as invalid if a RFU field is set, we do not know the
	 * size of this future field, hence will cause incorrect calculation of
	 * offset to ACAD field.
	 */
	if (h->rfu) {
		goto ull_scan_aux_rx_flush;
	}

	ptr = h->data;


### Response:
The response is incorrect. The response should be as follows:
