Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to drivers: can: mcux: flexcan: add missing mutex unlock in error path. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

	}

	if (alloc == -ENOSPC) {
		return alloc;
	}

	mcux_flexcan_can_filter_to_mbconfig(filter, &data->rx_cbs[alloc].mb_config,
		alloc = -ENOSPC;
	}

	k_mutex_unlock(&data->rx_mutex);

	return alloc;

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

	}

	if (alloc == -ENOSPC) {
		return alloc;
	}

	mcux_flexcan_can_filter_to_mbconfig(filter, &data->rx_cbs[alloc].mb_config,
		alloc = -ENOSPC;
	}

	k_mutex_unlock(&data->rx_mutex);

	return alloc;
The issue was with: drivers: can: mcux: flexcan: add missing mutex unlock in error path

Add missing mutex unlock to error handling path in
mcux_flexcan_add_rx_filter().

Fixes: #56284. Here is the corrected version:

	}

	if (alloc == -ENOSPC) {
		goto unlock;
	}

	mcux_flexcan_can_filter_to_mbconfig(filter, &data->rx_cbs[alloc].mb_config,
		alloc = -ENOSPC;
	}

unlock:
	k_mutex_unlock(&data->rx_mutex);

	return alloc;
