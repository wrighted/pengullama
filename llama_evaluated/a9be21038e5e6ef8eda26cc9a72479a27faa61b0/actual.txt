Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to drivers/pinctrl.h: Resolve PINCTRL_DT_STATE_INIT Cpp Compatibility. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

 */
#define PINCTRL_DT_STATE_INIT(prop, state)				       \
	{								       \
		.id = state,						       \
		.pins = prop ## _pins,					       \
		.pin_cnt = ARRAY_SIZE(prop ## _pins)			       \
	}

/**

### Response:
```
#define PINCTRL_DT_STATE_INIT(prop, state)				       \
	{								       \
		.id = state,						       \
		.pins = prop ## _pins,					       \
		.pin_cnt = ARRAY_SIZE(prop ## _pins)			       \
	}
```
The first line of the instruction provides the context for the code. The code is a macro definition that takes two arguments, `prop` and `state`. The macro expands to a structure with three fields: `.id`, `.pins`, and `.pin_cnt`. The `.id` field is initialized to the value of the `state` argument, the `.pins` field is initialized to the value of the `prop` argument followed by an underscore, and the `.pin_cnt` field is initialized to the result of calling the `ARRAY_SIZE` macro on the `prop` argument followed by an underscore.
