Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to net: dns: Fix timeout calculation with DNS retransmissions. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

	}

again:
	timeout_ms = k_ticks_to_ms_floor32(timeout.ticks);

	NET_DBG("Timeout %d", timeout_ms);


### Response:
I can see that you are having trouble with the code in relation to net: dns: Fix timeout calculation with DNS retransmissions. It looks like there is an issue with the calculation of the timeout value. The code appears to be trying to calculate the timeout in milliseconds, but it is not accounting for the DNS retransmissions. This could lead to incorrect timeout values being used, which could cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

To fix this issue, you will need to modify the code to account for the DNS retransmissions. One way to do this is to use a separate variable to store the number of retransmissions that have occurred, and then use that variable to adjust the timeout value. For example:

	int num_retransmissions = 0;
	...

	again:
		timeout_ms = k_ticks_to_ms_floor32(timeout.ticks);
		if (num_retransmissions > 0) {
			timeout_ms *= num_retransmissions;
		}
		NET_DBG("Timeout %d", timeout_ms);
		...
		num_retransmissions++;

This code will ensure that the timeout value is adjusted appropriately based on the number of retransmissions that have occurred.
