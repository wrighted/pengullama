Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to net: dns: Fix timeout calculation with DNS retransmissions. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

	}

again:
	timeout_ms = k_ticks_to_ms_floor32(timeout.ticks);

	NET_DBG("Timeout %d", timeout_ms);


### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

	}

again:
	timeout_ms = k_ticks_to_ms_floor32(timeout.ticks);

	NET_DBG("Timeout %d", timeout_ms);

The issue was with: net: dns: Fix timeout calculation with DNS retransmissions

With recently introduced DNS retransmission mechanism, a certain bug
could occur when calculating query timeout.

If the time until the final DNS timeout (as indicated by
CONFIG_NET_SOCKETS_DNS_TIMEOUT) was less than 1 millisecond, the actual
millisecond timeout value was rounded down, resulting in 0 ms timeout.
This in order was interpreted as invalid argument by dns_get_addr_info()
function, so in result, instead of reporting query timeout, the function
reported invalid argument error.

Fix this by rounding the millisecond timeout up, instead of down, so
that in any case, if the final timeout is not due, we always provide
non-zero timeout to dns_get_addr_info().. Here is the corrected version:

	}

again:
	timeout_ms = k_ticks_to_ms_ceil32(timeout.ticks);

	NET_DBG("Timeout %d", timeout_ms);
