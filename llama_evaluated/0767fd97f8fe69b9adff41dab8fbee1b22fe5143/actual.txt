Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to sd: sd_ops: fix DISK_IOCTL_CTRL_SYNC return code. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

		 * cache flush is not required here
		 */
		ret = sdmmc_wait_ready(card);
	default:
		ret = -ENOTSUP;
	}

### Response:
The code is wrong because the return value of sdmmc_wait_ready is not handled correctly. The code assumes that sdmmc_wait_ready will always return 0, but this is not the case. The correct way to handle the return value is to check for the error code and handle it appropriately. For example, if the error code is -ENOTSUP, then the code should return -ENOTSUP instead of 0.
