Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to sd: sd_ops: fix DISK_IOCTL_CTRL_SYNC return code. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

		 * cache flush is not required here
		 */
		ret = sdmmc_wait_ready(card);
	default:
		ret = -ENOTSUP;
	}

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

		 * cache flush is not required here
		 */
		ret = sdmmc_wait_ready(card);
	default:
		ret = -ENOTSUP;
	}
The issue was with: sd: sd_ops: fix DISK_IOCTL_CTRL_SYNC return code

SD IOCTL handling for DISK_IOCTL_CTRL_SYNC was falling through to the
default return statement, and returning an error when disk sync
succeeded. Fix this issue by properly breaking in IOCTL handler.. Here is the corrected version:

		 * cache flush is not required here
		 */
		ret = sdmmc_wait_ready(card);
		break;
	default:
		ret = -ENOTSUP;
	}
