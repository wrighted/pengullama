Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to sys: atomic_c: skip syscall tracing. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

#endif

#ifdef CONFIG_ATOMIC_OPERATIONS_C
#include <syscalls/atomic_c.h>
#endif

#endif /* ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_SYS_ATOMIC_C_H_ */

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

#endif

#ifdef CONFIG_ATOMIC_OPERATIONS_C
#include <syscalls/atomic_c.h>
#endif

#endif /* ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_SYS_ATOMIC_C_H_ */
The issue was with: sys: atomic_c: skip syscall tracing

This skips syscall tracing on atomic_c.h, as the compiler
does not like "({ ... tracing code ... })" and complains:

  error: expected identifier or '(' before '{' token

Even though there is already a '(' before '{'.. Here is the corrected version:

#endif

#ifdef CONFIG_ATOMIC_OPERATIONS_C

#ifndef DISABLE_SYSCALL_TRACING
/* Skip defining macros of atomic_*() for syscall tracing.
* Compiler does not like "({ ... tracing code ... })" and complains
*
*   error: expected identifier or '(' before '{' token
*
* ... even though there is a '(' before '{'.
*/
#define DISABLE_SYSCALL_TRACING
#define _REMOVE_DISABLE_SYSCALL_TRACING
#endif

#include <syscalls/atomic_c.h>

#ifdef _REMOVE_DISABLE_SYSCALL_TRACING
#undef DISABLE_SYSCALL_TRACING
#undef _REMOVE_DISABLE_SYSCALL_TRACING
#endif

#endif

#endif /* ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_SYS_ATOMIC_C_H_ */
