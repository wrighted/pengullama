Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to sys: atomic_c: skip syscall tracing. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

#endif

#ifdef CONFIG_ATOMIC_OPERATIONS_C
#include <syscalls/atomic_c.h>
#endif

#endif /* ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_SYS_ATOMIC_C_H_ */
