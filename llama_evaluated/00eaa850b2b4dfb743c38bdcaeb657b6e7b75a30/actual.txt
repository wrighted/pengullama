Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to drivers: input: sbus: Fix incorrect index reference of INPUT_SBUS_INIT. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:


#define INPUT_SBUS_INIT(n)                                                                         \
                                                                                                   \
	static const struct sbus_input_channel input_##id[] = {                                    \
		DT_INST_FOREACH_CHILD(n, SBUS_INPUT_CHANNEL_INITIALIZER)                           \
	};                                                                                         \
	DT_INST_FOREACH_CHILD(n, INPUT_CHANNEL_CHECK)                                              \
	static struct input_sbus_data sbus_data_##n;                                               \
                                                                                                   \
	static const struct input_sbus_config sbus_cfg_##n = {                                     \
		.channel_info = input_##id,                                                        \
		.uart_dev = DEVICE_DT_GET(DT_INST_BUS(n)),                                         \
		.num_channels = ARRAY_SIZE(input_##id),                                            \
		.cb = sbus_uart_isr,                                                               \
	};                                                                                         \
                                                                                                   \

### Response:
The problem with the code is that it is not properly formatted. The code is supposed to be indented and the curly braces are not properly aligned. This can cause confusion when reading the code and can lead to errors in the program.

Here is the corrected code:

#define INPUT_SBUS_INIT(n)                                                                 \
                                                                                       \
	static const struct sbus_input_channel input_##id[] = {                       \
		DT_INST_FOREACH_CHILD(n, SBUS_INPUT_CHANNEL_INITIALIZER)              \
	};                                                                             \
	DT_INST_FOREACH_CHILD(n, INPUT_CHANNEL_CHECK)                                \
	static struct input_sbus_data sbus_data_##n;                                  \
                                                                                       \
	static const struct input_sbus_config sbus_cfg_##n = {                        \
		.channel_info = input_##id,                                           \
		.uart_dev = DEVICE_DT_GET(DT_INST_BUS(n)),                            \
		.num_channels = ARRAY_SIZE(input_##id),                               \
		.cb = sbus_uart_isr,                                                  \
	};                                                                             \
                                                                                       \
