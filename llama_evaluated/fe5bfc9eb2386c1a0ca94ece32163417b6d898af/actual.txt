Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to driver: sensor: adxl372: Bug fix for status2 reg. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

	}

	if (fifo_entries) {
		length += 2U;
	}

	ret = data->hw_tf->read_reg_multiple(dev, ADXL372_STATUS_1, buf, length);

### Response:
The first error I noticed was the missing semicolon at the end of line 4. I also noticed that the variable "length" is not initialized in the code, which means that the value is undefined. In line 7, the variable "length" is used to determine the number of bytes to read from the device, but since it is undefined, the value of "length" is not known. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the code.

### Explanation:
In this case, the code is trying to read multiple registers from the device, but the variable "length" is not initialized, which means that the value is undefined. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the code.
