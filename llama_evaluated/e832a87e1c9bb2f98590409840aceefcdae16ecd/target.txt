Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to include: usb: include usb_ch9.h. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

#define ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_USB_HID_CLASS_DEVICE_H_

#include <zephyr/usb/class/hid.h>

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

#define ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_USB_HID_CLASS_DEVICE_H_

#include <zephyr/usb/class/hid.h>

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
The issue was with: include: usb: include usb_ch9.h

In usb_hid.h `struct usb_setup_packet` is used. This is defined in
usb_ch9.h but not included in usb_hid.h which leads to build errors when
you include the usb header files in the wrong order. This commit fixes
this behaviour.. Here is the corrected version:

#define ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_USB_HID_CLASS_DEVICE_H_

#include <zephyr/usb/class/hid.h>
#include <zephyr/usb/usb_ch9.h>

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
