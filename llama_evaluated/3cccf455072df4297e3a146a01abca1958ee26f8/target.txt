Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to cache: aspeed: Fix typo of CACHE_ENABLE bit. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:


	syscon_read_reg(dev, CACHE_FUNC_CTRL_REG, &ctrl);

	return (ctrl & CCHE_EANABLE) ? CACHE_LINE_SIZE : 0;
}
#endif /* CONFIG_ICACHE_LINE_SIZE_DETECT */

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:


	syscon_read_reg(dev, CACHE_FUNC_CTRL_REG, &ctrl);

	return (ctrl & CCHE_EANABLE) ? CACHE_LINE_SIZE : 0;
}
#endif /* CONFIG_ICACHE_LINE_SIZE_DETECT */
The issue was with: cache: aspeed: Fix typo of CACHE_ENABLE bit

Fix the typo "CCHE_EANABLE" in cache_instr_line_size_get.

Fixes: 74e1b1781a84 ("cache: aspeed: Rework driver"). Here is the corrected version:


	syscon_read_reg(dev, CACHE_FUNC_CTRL_REG, &ctrl);

	return (ctrl & CACHE_ENABLE) ? CACHE_LINE_SIZE : 0;
}
#endif /* CONFIG_ICACHE_LINE_SIZE_DETECT */
