Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to cache: aspeed: Fix typo of CACHE_ENABLE bit. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:


	syscon_read_reg(dev, CACHE_FUNC_CTRL_REG, &ctrl);

	return (ctrl & CCHE_EANABLE)? CACHE_LINE_SIZE : 0;
}
#endif /* CONFIG_ICACHE_LINE_SIZE_DETECT */

### Response:
Here is the fixed code:


	syscon_read_reg(dev, CACHE_FUNC_CTRL_REG, &ctrl);

	return (ctrl & CACHE_ENABLE)? CACHE_LINE_SIZE : 0;
}
#endif /* CONFIG_ICACHE_LINE_SIZE_DETECT */

### Explanation:
In the original code, the constant CACHE_ENABLE was misspelled as CCHE_EANABLE. This is a typo and should be corrected to match the constant's intended value. The corrected code fixes this typo and ensures that the intended value is used in the function.
