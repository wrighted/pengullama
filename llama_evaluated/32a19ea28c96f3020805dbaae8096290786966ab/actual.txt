Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to drivers/espi: it8xxx2: Fix mask when SRAM size not the power of 2. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

 */
#define IT8XXX2_ESPI_H2RAM_POOL_SIZE_MAX 0x1000
#define IT8XXX2_ESPI_H2RAM_OFFSET_MASK   GENMASK(5, 0)
#define IT8XXX2_ESPI_H2RAM_BASEADDR_MASK (KB(CONFIG_SRAM_SIZE) - 1)

#if defined(CONFIG_ESPI_PERIPHERAL_ACPI_SHM_REGION)
#define H2RAM_ACPI_SHM_MAX ((CONFIG_ESPI_IT8XXX2_ACPI_SHM_H2RAM_SIZE) + \

### Response:
The code is correct, but there is a mistake in the definition of the macros. The correct code should be as follows:

 */
#define IT8XXX2_ESPI_H2RAM_POOL_SIZE_MAX 0x1000
#define IT8XXX2_ESPI_H2RAM_OFFSET_MASK   GENMASK(5, 0)
#define IT8XXX2_ESPI_H2RAM_BASEADDR_MASK (KB(CONFIG_SRAM_SIZE) - 1)

#if defined(CONFIG_ESPI_PERIPHERAL_ACPI_SHM_REGION)
#define H2RAM_ACPI_SHM_MAX ((CONFIG_ESPI_IT8XXX2_ACPI_SHM_H2RAM_SIZE) + \

The mistake is in the definition of the macro IT8XXX2_ESPI_H2RAM_BASEADDR_MASK. The correct definition should be as follows:

#define IT8XXX2_ESPI_H2RAM_BASEADDR_MASK (KB(CONFIG_SRAM_SIZE) - 1)

The mistake is that the macro is defined as a mask, but it should be defined as a number. The correct definition should be as follows:

#define IT8XXX2_ESPI_H2RAM_BASEADDR_NUM (KB(CONFIG_SRAM_SIZE) - 1)

The mistake is that the macro is defined as a mask, but it should be defined as a number. The correct definition should be as follows:

#define IT8XXX2_ESPI_H2RAM_BASEADDR_NUM (KB(CONFIG_SRAM_SIZE) - 1)
