Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to Bluetooth: Controller: Fix coverity issue 340852. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:


	cte_info.type = df_cfg->cte_type;
	cte_info.time = df_cfg->cte_length;

	/* Note: ULL_ADV_PDU_EXTRA_DATA_ALLOC_ALWAYS is just information that extra_data
	 * is required in case of this ull_adv_sync_pdu_alloc.

### Response:
The code is missing a semicolon at the end of the second line. This causes the code to be syntactically incorrect and will result in a compiler error. The correct code is as follows:

	cte_info.type = df_cfg->cte_type;
	cte_info.time = df_cfg->cte_length;
