Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to net: lib: sntp: add support for unspecified IP-family type. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

	uint64_t deadline;
	uint32_t iter_timeout;

	hints.ai_family = AF_INET;
	hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_DGRAM;
	hints.ai_protocol = 0;
	/* 123 is the standard SNTP port per RFC4330 */

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

	uint64_t deadline;
	uint32_t iter_timeout;

	hints.ai_family = AF_INET;
	hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_DGRAM;
	hints.ai_protocol = 0;
	/* 123 is the standard SNTP port per RFC4330 */
The issue was with: net: lib: sntp: add support for unspecified IP-family type

`sntp_simple()` was forcing to resolve SNTP-server's URL into IPv4 address
addresses. This was not allowing sntp_init() to succeed in case the system
 did not support IPv4 addresses (returning EPFNOSUPPORT, ie. Protocol
Family error).
Now by default SNTP has unspecified family type and it relies on
`net_getaddrinfo_addr_str()` to be able to resolve literal server URLs
into the supported IP family type.. Here is the corrected version:

	uint64_t deadline;
	uint32_t iter_timeout;

	hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;
	hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_DGRAM;
	hints.ai_protocol = 0;
	/* 123 is the standard SNTP port per RFC4330 */
