Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to drivers: gpio: imx rt11xx: fix wrong gpio pull disable mask. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

			}
		} else {
			/* Set pin to no pull */
			reg |= IOMUXC_SW_PAD_CTL_PAD_PUS_MASK;
		}
		/* PDRV/SNVS/LPSR reg have different ODE bits */
		if (config->pin_muxes[cfg_idx].pdrv_mux) {

### Response:
I've looked over the code and I believe the issue lies in the if statement. It seems that the condition is not being met, causing the else statement to run. I would suggest adding a print statement to see what the value of "config->pin_muxes[cfg_idx].pdrv_mux" is. This will help you determine if the issue is with the condition or with the code in the else statement.
