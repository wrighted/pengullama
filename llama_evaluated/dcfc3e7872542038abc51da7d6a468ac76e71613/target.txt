Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to drivers: gpio: imx rt11xx: fix wrong gpio pull disable mask. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

			}
		} else {
			/* Set pin to no pull */
			reg |= IOMUXC_SW_PAD_CTL_PAD_PUS_MASK;
		}
		/* PDRV/SNVS/LPSR reg have different ODE bits */
		if (config->pin_muxes[cfg_idx].pdrv_mux) {

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

			}
		} else {
			/* Set pin to no pull */
			reg |= IOMUXC_SW_PAD_CTL_PAD_PUS_MASK;
		}
		/* PDRV/SNVS/LPSR reg have different ODE bits */
		if (config->pin_muxes[cfg_idx].pdrv_mux) {
The issue was with: drivers: gpio: imx rt11xx: fix wrong gpio pull disable mask

Fixes: #75390
A wrong bit mask (wrong: IOMUXC_SW_PAD_CTL_PAD_PUS_MASK = 0x8) was used.
That bit mask is for PUE/PUS-type gpio registers, but this is the
section for registers with alternative PULL (PDRV) type layout.
Right bit mask: IOMUXC_SW_PAD_CTL_PAD_PULL_MASK. Here is the corrected version:

			}
		} else {
			/* Set pin to no pull */
			reg |= IOMUXC_SW_PAD_CTL_PAD_PULL_MASK;
		}
		/* PDRV/SNVS/LPSR reg have different ODE bits */
		if (config->pin_muxes[cfg_idx].pdrv_mux) {
