Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to libc/minimal: Use CODE_UNREACHABLE in abort(). Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

{
	printk("abort()\n");
	k_panic();
}

### Response:
The code is incorrect because it is missing the required header file that contains the abort() function. To fix the issue, include the necessary header file at the beginning of the code. The correct code should look like this:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void abort(void)
{
	fprintf(stderr, "abort()\n");
	exit(1);
}

int main(void)
{
	abort();
	return 0;
}

In this corrected version of the code, we included both stdio.h and stdlib.h because they contain the functions fprintf() and exit(), respectively. Additionally, we added a call to fprintf() within the abort() function to print out "abort()" to stderr before calling exit(). This will cause the program to terminate with an error code of 1.
