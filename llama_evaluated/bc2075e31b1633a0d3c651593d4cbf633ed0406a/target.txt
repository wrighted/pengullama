Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to libc/minimal: Use CODE_UNREACHABLE in abort(). Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

{
	printk("abort()\n");
	k_panic();
}

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

{
	printk("abort()\n");
	k_panic();
}
The issue was with: libc/minimal: Use CODE_UNREACHABLE in abort()

This allows this function to build without -ffreestanding for testing.


fixup. Here is the corrected version:

{
	printk("abort()\n");
	k_panic();
	CODE_UNREACHABLE;
}
