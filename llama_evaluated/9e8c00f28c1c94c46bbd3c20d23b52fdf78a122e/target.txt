Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to drivers: stm32-rtc: return -ENODATA when RTC is uninitialized. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

		return err;
	}

	do {
		/* read date, time and subseconds and relaunch if a day increment occurred
		 * while doing so as it will result in an erroneous result otherwise

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

		return err;
	}

	do {
		/* read date, time and subseconds and relaunch if a day increment occurred
		 * while doing so as it will result in an erroneous result otherwise
The issue was with: drivers: stm32-rtc: return -ENODATA when RTC is uninitialized

rtc_get_time() on STM32 does not implement the -ENODATA return code.
This prevents testing the initialisation status of the RTC.

Fixed by reading INITS flag and adding a error path in
rtc_stm32_get_time().. Here is the corrected version:

		return err;
	}

	if (!LL_RTC_IsActiveFlag_INITS(RTC)) {
		/* INITS flag is set when the calendar has been initialiazed. This flag is
		 * reset only on backup domain reset, so it can be read after a system
		 * reset to check if the calendar has been initialized.
		 */
		k_mutex_unlock(&data->lock);
		return -ENODATA;
	}

	do {
		/* read date, time and subseconds and relaunch if a day increment occurred
		 * while doing so as it will result in an erroneous result otherwise
