Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to drivers: charger: bq25180: fix return value check. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

	}

	if (cfg->initial_current_microamp > 0) {
		bq25180_set_charge_current(dev, cfg->initial_current_microamp);
		if (ret < 0) {
			return ret;
		}

### Response:
The code is incorrect because it lacks proper indentation. The indentation is used to indicate the level of nesting and to make the code more readable. The correct code should be like this:

	}

	if (cfg->initial_current_microamp > 0) {
		bq25180_set_charge_current(dev, cfg->initial_current_microamp);
		if (ret < 0) {
			return ret;
		}
	}
