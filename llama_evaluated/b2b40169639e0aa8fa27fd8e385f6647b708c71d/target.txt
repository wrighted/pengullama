Fix missing check of the return value of `bq25180_set_charge_current`
function, resulting in logically dead code, as indicated by Coverity
CID 347197.. Here is the corrected version:

	}

	if (cfg->initial_current_microamp > 0) {
		ret = bq25180_set_charge_current(dev, cfg->initial_current_microamp);
		if (ret < 0) {
			return ret;
		}
