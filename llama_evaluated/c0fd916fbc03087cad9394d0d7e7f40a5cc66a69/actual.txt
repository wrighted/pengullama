Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to drivers: sensor: wsen_itds: fix device ID mismatch return value. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:


	if (rval!= ITDS_DEVICE_ID) {
		LOG_ERR("device ID mismatch: %x", rval);
		return ret;
	}

	ret = i2c_reg_update_byte_dt(&cfg->i2c, ITDS_REG_CTRL2,

### Response:
The code is incorrect. The variable "rval" is used to store the return value of the function "itds_device_id". If the value of "rval" is not equal to "ITDS_DEVICE_ID", an error message is printed and the function returns. However, the code does not check if the value of "rval" is equal to "ITDS_DEVICE_ID". This means that if "rval" is not equal to "ITDS_DEVICE_ID", the code will print an error message and return without checking if "rval" is equal to "ITDS_DEVICE_ID". This is incorrect and will cause the code to fail. The correct code should be:

	if (rval!= ITDS_DEVICE_ID) {
		LOG_ERR("device ID mismatch: %x", rval);
		return ret;
	} else {
		LOG_INFO("device ID matches: %x", rval);
		return ret;
	}

This code checks if "rval" is equal to "ITDS_DEVICE_ID". If it is not equal, an error message is printed and the function returns. If "rval" is equal to "ITDS_DEVICE_ID", an information message is printed and the function returns. This ensures that the code checks if "rval" is equal to "ITDS_DEVICE_ID" before returning.
