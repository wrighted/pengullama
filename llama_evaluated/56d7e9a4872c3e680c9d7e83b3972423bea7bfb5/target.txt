Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to modules: hostap: Fix typo in NM unregistration. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

		goto out;
	}

	ret = wifi_nm_unregister_mgd_iface(wifi_nm_get_instance("wpa_supplicant"), iface);
	if (ret) {
		LOG_ERR("Failed to unregister mgd iface %s with native stack (%d)",
			ifname, ret);

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

		goto out;
	}

	ret = wifi_nm_unregister_mgd_iface(wifi_nm_get_instance("wpa_supplicant"), iface);
	if (ret) {
		LOG_ERR("Failed to unregister mgd iface %s with native stack (%d)",
			ifname, ret);
The issue was with: modules: hostap: Fix typo in NM unregistration

The module name is not modified in remove.. Here is the corrected version:

		goto out;
	}

	ret = wifi_nm_unregister_mgd_iface(wifi_nm_get_instance("wifi_supplicant"), iface);
	if (ret) {
		LOG_ERR("Failed to unregister mgd iface %s with native stack (%d)",
			ifname, ret);
