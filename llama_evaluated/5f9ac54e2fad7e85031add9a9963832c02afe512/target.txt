Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to Bluetooth: Mesh: Fix unable sent mesh message. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

		return;
	}

	if (!bt_mesh_adv_gatt_send()) {
		atomic_set_bit(adv->flags, ADV_FLAG_PROXY);
	}

	if (atomic_test_and_clear_bit(adv->flags, ADV_FLAG_SCHEDULE_PENDING)) {

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

		return;
	}

	if (!bt_mesh_adv_gatt_send()) {
		atomic_set_bit(adv->flags, ADV_FLAG_PROXY);
	}

	if (atomic_test_and_clear_bit(adv->flags, ADV_FLAG_SCHEDULE_PENDING)) {
The issue was with: Bluetooth: Mesh: Fix unable sent mesh message

When proxy advertising enabled, but at same time, the
connection event report, will cause `ADV_FLAG_PROXY` not
set, so cb `connected` will not be process, cause mesh message
unable to sent.

Fixes: https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/issues/58721. Here is the corrected version:

		return;
	}

	atomic_set_bit(adv->flags, ADV_FLAG_PROXY);

	if (bt_mesh_adv_gatt_send()) {
		atomic_clear_bit(adv->flags, ADV_FLAG_PROXY);
	}

	if (atomic_test_and_clear_bit(adv->flags, ADV_FLAG_SCHEDULE_PENDING)) {
