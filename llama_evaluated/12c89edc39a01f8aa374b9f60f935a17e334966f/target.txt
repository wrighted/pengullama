Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to Bluetooth: ascs: Fix return without state change nor response. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

		err = ascs_disconnect_stream(stream);
		if (err < 0) {
			LOG_ERR("Failed to disconnect stream %p: %d", stream, err);
			return;
		}
	}


### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

		err = ascs_disconnect_stream(stream);
		if (err < 0) {
			LOG_ERR("Failed to disconnect stream %p: %d", stream, err);
			return;
		}
	}

The issue was with: Bluetooth: ascs: Fix return without state change nor response

This fixes missing control point status and ASE status change, when
failed to disconnect the CIS. As the server may, but does not have to
disconnect the CIS, the operation should not be considered as failed
when it happens.. Here is the corrected version:

		err = ascs_disconnect_stream(stream);
		if (err < 0) {
			LOG_ERR("Failed to disconnect stream %p: %d", stream, err);
		}
	}
