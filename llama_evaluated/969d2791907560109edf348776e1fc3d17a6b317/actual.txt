Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to samples: Bluetooth: Unicast client missing err check on sem. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:


	for (size_t i = 0U; i < configured_stream_count; i++) {
		printk("QoS: waiting for %zu streams\n", configured_stream_count);
		k_sem_take(&sem_stream_qos, K_FOREVER);
	}

	return 0;

### Response:
The code is missing a check for the sem_stream_qos. This could cause the code to run indefinitely. The check should be added before the k_sem_take call. Here is the corrected code:


	for (size_t i = 0U; i < configured_stream_count; i++) {
		printk("QoS: waiting for %zu streams\n", configured_stream_count);
		if (k_sem_take(&sem_stream_qos, K_FOREVER)!= 0) {
			printk("QoS: failed to take semaphore\n");
			return -EIO;
		}
	}

	return 0;
