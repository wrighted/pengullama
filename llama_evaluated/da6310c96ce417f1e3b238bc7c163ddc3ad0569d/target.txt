Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to soc: mcxc: Enable bandgap buffer for on die temperature measurement. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:


void soc_early_init_hook(void)
{
	clock_init();
}


### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:


void soc_early_init_hook(void)
{
	clock_init();
}

The issue was with: soc: mcxc: Enable bandgap buffer for on die temperature measurement

Bandgap voltage is used for on die temperature measurement. Bandgap
buffer has to be enabled explicitly to get correct tempearature.
Enable the buffer if TEMP_KINETIS is selected.. Here is the corrected version:


void soc_early_init_hook(void)
{
#ifdef CONFIG_TEMP_KINETIS
	/* enable bandgap buffer */
	PMC->REGSC |= PMC_REGSC_BGBE_MASK;
#endif /* CONFIG_TEMP_KINETIS */

	clock_init();
}
