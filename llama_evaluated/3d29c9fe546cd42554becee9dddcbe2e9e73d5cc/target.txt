Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to kernel: timeout: fix issue with z_timeout_expires. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

	k_ticks_t ticks = 0;

	K_SPINLOCK(&timeout_lock) {
		ticks = curr_tick + timeout_rem(timeout);
	}

	return ticks;

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

	k_ticks_t ticks = 0;

	K_SPINLOCK(&timeout_lock) {
		ticks = curr_tick + timeout_rem(timeout);
	}

	return ticks;
The issue was with: kernel: timeout: fix issue with z_timeout_expires

- issue found with Ztest case of test_thread_timeout_remaining_expires
  on Intel ISH platform when adjust CONFIG_SYS_CLOCK_TICKS_PER_SEC
  to 10k.
- timeout_rem() return exact remaining ticks which is calibrated by
  decrease elapsed(), while z_timeout_expires try to get expire ticks
  to be timeout using current tick as base, so need get exact current
  ticks by plus elasped().. Here is the corrected version:

	k_ticks_t ticks = 0;

	K_SPINLOCK(&timeout_lock) {
		ticks = curr_tick + timeout_rem(timeout) + elapsed();
	}

	return ticks;
