Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to drivers: sensor: mpu9250: fix mismatched value in log message. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

	drv_data->accel_sensitivity_shift = 14 - cfg->accel_fs;

	if (cfg->gyro_fs > MPU9250_GYRO_FS_MAX) {
		LOG_ERR("Gyro FS is too big: %d", cfg->accel_fs);
		return -EINVAL;
	}


### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

	drv_data->accel_sensitivity_shift = 14 - cfg->accel_fs;

	if (cfg->gyro_fs > MPU9250_GYRO_FS_MAX) {
		LOG_ERR("Gyro FS is too big: %d", cfg->accel_fs);
		return -EINVAL;
	}

The issue was with: drivers: sensor: mpu9250: fix mismatched value in log message

The print message prints cfg->accel_fs when cfg->gyro_fs is too big.. Here is the corrected version:

	drv_data->accel_sensitivity_shift = 14 - cfg->accel_fs;

	if (cfg->gyro_fs > MPU9250_GYRO_FS_MAX) {
		LOG_ERR("Gyro FS is too big: %d", cfg->gyro_fs);
		return -EINVAL;
	}
