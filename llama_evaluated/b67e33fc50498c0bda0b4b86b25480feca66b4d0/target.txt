Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to sensor: bmi160: fix the issue of missing gpio cfg for i2c. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

	{					       \
		.bus.i2c = I2C_DT_SPEC_INST_GET(inst), \
		.bus_io = &bmi160_bus_io_i2c,	       \
	}

#define BMI160_DEFINE_I2C(inst)							    \

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

	{					       \
		.bus.i2c = I2C_DT_SPEC_INST_GET(inst), \
		.bus_io = &bmi160_bus_io_i2c,	       \
	}

#define BMI160_DEFINE_I2C(inst)							    \
The issue was with: sensor: bmi160: fix the issue of missing gpio cfg for i2c

Add BMI160_TRIGGER_CFG in bmi160_cfg for i2c instance when
trigger mode enabled.. Here is the corrected version:

	{					       \
		.bus.i2c = I2C_DT_SPEC_INST_GET(inst), \
		.bus_io = &bmi160_bus_io_i2c,	       \
		BMI160_TRIGGER_CFG(inst)	       \
	}

#define BMI160_DEFINE_I2C(inst)							    \
