Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to sensor: ism330dhcx: Incorrect handle passed to ctx struct in SPI mode. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

	data->ctx_spi.mdelay = (stmdev_mdelay_ptr) stmemsc_mdelay;

	data->ctx = &data->ctx_spi;
	data->ctx->handle = data;

	return 0;
}

### Response:
I think there is a typo in the code. The variable data->ctx_spi.mdelay is not assigned to the variable data->ctx_spi.handle. I think the code should be changed to:

	data->ctx_spi.mdelay = (stmdev_mdelay_ptr) stmemsc_mdelay;

	data->ctx_spi.handle = data;

	return 0;
}
