Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to sensor: ism330dhcx: Incorrect handle passed to ctx struct in SPI mode. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

	data->ctx_spi.mdelay = (stmdev_mdelay_ptr) stmemsc_mdelay;

	data->ctx = &data->ctx_spi;
	data->ctx->handle = data;

	return 0;
}

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

	data->ctx_spi.mdelay = (stmdev_mdelay_ptr) stmemsc_mdelay;

	data->ctx = &data->ctx_spi;
	data->ctx->handle = data;

	return 0;
}
The issue was with: sensor: ism330dhcx: Incorrect handle passed to ctx struct in SPI mode

The ISM330DHCX driver immediately segfaults when run in SPI mode. A bad
pointer is being passed into the `dev` param of `ism330dhcx_spi_read`.
Tracing this back, it appears that the handle field of the ctx struct
is being set to the device's data struct while `ism330dhcx_spi_read`
expects `ctx->handle` to be a pointer to a device struct.

Modify `ism330dhcx_spi_init()` to insert the correct pointer into the
context struct. Unfortunately this requires a cast to discard the
`const` qualifier, but this is how it is done in I2C mode (see
`ism330dhcx_i2c_init()`). The only other way would be to change the
declaration of `stmdev_ctx_t`, which is owned by the HAL module.. Here is the corrected version:

	data->ctx_spi.mdelay = (stmdev_mdelay_ptr) stmemsc_mdelay;

	data->ctx = &data->ctx_spi;
	data->ctx->handle = (void *)dev;

	return 0;
