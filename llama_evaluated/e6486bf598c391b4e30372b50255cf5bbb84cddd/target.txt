Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to drivers: interrupt_controller: ra_icu: minor cleanups. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

	return 0;
}

DEVICE_DT_INST_DEFINE(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, PRE_KERNEL_1, CONFIG_INTC_INIT_PRIORITY,
		      NULL);

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

	return 0;
}

DEVICE_DT_INST_DEFINE(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, PRE_KERNEL_1, CONFIG_INTC_INIT_PRIORITY,
		      NULL);
The issue was with: drivers: interrupt_controller: ra_icu: minor cleanups

- Corrected indentation with clang-format. Here is the corrected version:

	return 0;
}

DEVICE_DT_INST_DEFINE(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, PRE_KERNEL_1, CONFIG_INTC_INIT_PRIORITY, NULL);
