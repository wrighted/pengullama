### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to drivers: charger: Corrects typo in property documentation. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

	 * Configuration to issue a notification to the system based on the input current
	 * level and timing
	 *
	 * Value should be of type struct charger_input_current_notifier
	 */
	CHARGER_PROP_INPUT_CURRENT_NOTIFICATION,
	/** Reserved to demark end of common charger properties */

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

	 * Configuration to issue a notification to the system based on the input current
	 * level and timing
	 *
	 * Value should be of type struct charger_input_current_notifier
	 */
	CHARGER_PROP_INPUT_CURRENT_NOTIFICATION,
	/** Reserved to demark end of common charger properties */
The issue was with: drivers: charger: Corrects typo in property documentation

Corrects expected type mentioned in the documentation of the
CHARGER_PROP_INPUT_CURRENT_NOTIFICATION.. Here is the corrected version:

	 * Configuration to issue a notification to the system based on the input current
	 * level and timing
	 *
	 * Value should be of type struct charger_current_notifier
	 */
	CHARGER_PROP_INPUT_CURRENT_NOTIFICATION,
	/** Reserved to demark end of common charger properties */
