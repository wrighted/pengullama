Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to drivers: sensor: Fix adxl345 sample fetch return value. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

		data->bufz[s] = sample.z;
	}

	return samples_count;
}

static int adxl345_channel_get(const struct device *dev,

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

		data->bufz[s] = sample.z;
	}

	return samples_count;
}

static int adxl345_channel_get(const struct device *dev,
The issue was with: drivers: sensor: Fix adxl345 sample fetch return value

Fixes the adxl345 accelerometer driver to return zero on sample fetch
success, as specified by the sensor driver API. Prior to this change,
the driver incorrectly returned a positive non-zero value on sample
fetch success, which in turn caused a bus fault getting data with the
sensor shell.. Here is the corrected version:

		data->bufz[s] = sample.z;
	}

	return 0;
}
