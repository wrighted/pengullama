Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to Revert "tests: drivers: counter: basic_api: Tweak test timing". Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

{
	int err;
	uint32_t cnt;
	uint32_t us = 1500;
	uint32_t ticks = counter_us_to_ticks(dev, us);
	uint32_t top = counter_get_top_value(dev);


### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

{
	int err;
	uint32_t cnt;
	uint32_t us = 1500;
	uint32_t ticks = counter_us_to_ticks(dev, us);
	uint32_t top = counter_get_top_value(dev);

The issue was with: Revert "tests: drivers: counter: basic_api: Tweak test timing"

This reverts commit 331442f0591532b0822b2d54d85a221d5a36fbe4.

Change was introduced because it was failing on slow core
(nrf54h20/cpuppr) however it turned out that there was a bug in the
driver and now test passes without this tweak which make the test
last twice longer.. Here is the corrected version:

{
	int err;
	uint32_t cnt;
	uint32_t us = 1000;
	uint32_t ticks = counter_us_to_ticks(dev, us);
	uint32_t top = counter_get_top_value(dev);
