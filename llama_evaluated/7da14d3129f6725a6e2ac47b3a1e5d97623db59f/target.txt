Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to net: shell: Clarify the name of the virtual interface. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

			name = "<unknown>";
		}

		PR("Name      : %s\n", name);

		orig_iface = net_virtual_get_iface(iface);
		if (orig_iface == NULL) {

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

			name = "<unknown>";
		}

		PR("Name      : %s\n", name);

		orig_iface = net_virtual_get_iface(iface);
		if (orig_iface == NULL) {
The issue was with: net: shell: Clarify the name of the virtual interface

The net-shell printed virtual interface name so that it got
the impression it was the network interface name which is not
correct. Now the name is printed as "Virtual name" which is
unambiguous.. Here is the corrected version:

			name = "<unknown>";
		}

		PR("Virtual name : %s\n", name);

		orig_iface = net_virtual_get_iface(iface);
		if (orig_iface == NULL) {
