Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to power_domain: intel_adsp: correct function call order. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:


	switch (action) {
	case PM_DEVICE_ACTION_RESUME:
		pm_device_children_action_run(dev, PM_DEVICE_ACTION_TURN_ON, NULL);
		pd_intel_adsp_set_power_enable(reg_bits, true);
		break;
	case PM_DEVICE_ACTION_SUSPEND:
		pm_device_children_action_run(dev, PM_DEVICE_ACTION_TURN_OFF, NULL);

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:


	switch (action) {
	case PM_DEVICE_ACTION_RESUME:
		pm_device_children_action_run(dev, PM_DEVICE_ACTION_TURN_ON, NULL);
		pd_intel_adsp_set_power_enable(reg_bits, true);
		break;
	case PM_DEVICE_ACTION_SUSPEND:
		pm_device_children_action_run(dev, PM_DEVICE_ACTION_TURN_OFF, NULL);
The issue was with: power_domain: intel_adsp: correct function call order

Changing function call order. We need to first power-up the power domain
before we turn on the devices.. Here is the corrected version:


	switch (action) {
	case PM_DEVICE_ACTION_RESUME:
		pd_intel_adsp_set_power_enable(reg_bits, true);
		pm_device_children_action_run(dev, PM_DEVICE_ACTION_TURN_ON, NULL);
		break;
	case PM_DEVICE_ACTION_SUSPEND:
		pm_device_children_action_run(dev, PM_DEVICE_ACTION_TURN_OFF, NULL);
