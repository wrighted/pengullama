### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to drivers: dma: dma_nxp_edma: allow channel re-configuration. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

		}
		break;
	case CHAN_STATE_CONFIGURED:
		if (next!= CHAN_STATE_STARTED) {
			return -EPERM;
		}
		break;

### Response:
The code is missing a case statement to handle the case where the channel is already configured and the next state is not started. This could cause unexpected behavior or a crash.

### Explanation:
The code is missing a case statement to handle the case where the channel is already configured and the next state is not started. This could cause unexpected behavior or a crash. The correct code should be:

		}
		break;
	case CHAN_STATE_CONFIGURED:
		if (next!= CHAN_STATE_STARTED) {
			return -EPERM;
		}
		break;
	case CHAN_STATE_STARTED:
		if (next!= CHAN_STATE_STOPPED) {
			return -EPERM;
		}
		break;
	case CHAN_STATE_STOPPED:
		if (next!= CHAN_STATE_CONFIGURED) {
			return -EPERM;
		}
		break;
	default:
		break;
