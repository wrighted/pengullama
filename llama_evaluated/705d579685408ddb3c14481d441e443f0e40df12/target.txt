Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to drivers: dma: dma_nxp_edma: allow channel re-configuration. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

		}
		break;
	case CHAN_STATE_CONFIGURED:
		if (next != CHAN_STATE_STARTED) {
			return -EPERM;
		}
		break;

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

		}
		break;
	case CHAN_STATE_CONFIGURED:
		if (next != CHAN_STATE_STARTED) {
			return -EPERM;
		}
		break;
The issue was with: drivers: dma: dma_nxp_edma: allow channel re-configuration

Currently, the state transition function doesn't allow
the re-configuration of an already configured channel
(i.e: CHAN_CONFIGURED -> CHAN_CONFIGURED transition). This
causes problems when using `pulseaudio` and `SOF` because
the same channel ends up being configured multiple times
in the beginning due to how pulse seems to work. Logically
speaking, re-configuring an already configured channel is
not wrong so this commit solves the issue by allowing
the CHAN_CONFIGURED -> CHAN_CONFIGURED transition.. Here is the corrected version:

		}
		break;
	case CHAN_STATE_CONFIGURED:
		if (next != CHAN_STATE_STARTED &&
		    next != CHAN_STATE_CONFIGURED) {
			return -EPERM;
		}
		break;
