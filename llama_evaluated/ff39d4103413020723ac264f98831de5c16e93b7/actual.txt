Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to Bluetooth: ssp: correct pairing failed callback. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:


		SYS_SLIST_FOR_EACH_CONTAINER_SAFE(&bt_auth_info_cbs, listener,
						  next, node) {
			if (listener->pairing_complete) {
				listener->pairing_complete(conn, status);
			}
		}
	}

### Response:
The problem with this code is that it is not properly formatted. The indentation is incorrect, and the syntax is not clear. Additionally, there are no comments or explanations provided, which makes it difficult to understand what the code is supposed to do. To fix this issue, I would recommend the following changes:

1. Fix the indentation by adding spaces before each line of code.
2. Add comments to explain what each line of code does.
3. Add explanations for any complex or confusing sections of code.

By making these changes, the code will be easier to read and understand, and it will be less likely to contain errors.
