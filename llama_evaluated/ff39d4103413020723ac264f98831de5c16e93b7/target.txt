Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to Bluetooth: ssp: correct pairing failed callback. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:


		SYS_SLIST_FOR_EACH_CONTAINER_SAFE(&bt_auth_info_cbs, listener,
						  next, node) {
			if (listener->pairing_complete) {
				listener->pairing_complete(conn, status);
			}
		}
	}

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:


		SYS_SLIST_FOR_EACH_CONTAINER_SAFE(&bt_auth_info_cbs, listener,
						  next, node) {
			if (listener->pairing_complete) {
				listener->pairing_complete(conn, status);
			}
		}
	}
The issue was with: Bluetooth: ssp: correct pairing failed callback

Current, the callback `pairing_complete` is called
when the pairing is filed. But there is a callback
`pairing_failed` for pairing failed case.

Correct the callback calling if pairing failed.
Call `pairing_failed` instead of `pairing_complete`
if the pairing failed.. Here is the corrected version:


		SYS_SLIST_FOR_EACH_CONTAINER_SAFE(&bt_auth_info_cbs, listener,
						  next, node) {
			if (listener->pairing_failed) {
				listener->pairing_failed(conn, status);
			}
		}
	}
