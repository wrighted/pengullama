Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to samples: drivers: uart: Detect missing FIFO mode in echo_bot. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

	}

	/* configure interrupt and callback to receive data */
	uart_irq_callback_user_data_set(uart_dev, serial_cb, NULL);
	uart_irq_rx_enable(uart_dev);

	print_uart("Hello! I'm your echo bot.\r\n");

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

	}

	/* configure interrupt and callback to receive data */
	uart_irq_callback_user_data_set(uart_dev, serial_cb, NULL);
	uart_irq_rx_enable(uart_dev);

	print_uart("Hello! I'm your echo bot.\r\n");
The issue was with: samples: drivers: uart: Detect missing FIFO mode in echo_bot

Print an error message if the UART doesn't support FIFO mode or FIFO
mode is not enabled.

Previously the sample would run with no errors, but wouldn't receive or
echo any data.. Here is the corrected version:

	}

	/* configure interrupt and callback to receive data */
	int ret = uart_irq_callback_user_data_set(uart_dev, serial_cb, NULL);

	if (ret < 0) {
		if (ret == -ENOTSUP) {
			printk("Interrupt-driven UART API support not enabled\n");
		} else if (ret == -ENOSYS) {
			printk("UART device does not support interrupt-driven API\n");
		} else {
			printk("Error setting UART callback: %d\n", ret);
		}
		return;
	}
	uart_irq_rx_enable(uart_dev);

	print_uart("Hello! I'm your echo bot.\r\n");
