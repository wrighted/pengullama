Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to test: Shorten object core API stats test name. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

	k_mutex_unlock(&test_mutex);
}

ZTEST(obj_core_stats_api, test_obj_core_stats_deregister)
{
	int  status;
	char buffer[sizeof(struct k_cycle_stats)];

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

	k_mutex_unlock(&test_mutex);
}

ZTEST(obj_core_stats_api, test_obj_core_stats_deregister)
{
	int  status;
	char buffer[sizeof(struct k_cycle_stats)];
The issue was with: test: Shorten object core API stats test name

Changing the name of the routine test_obj_core_stats_deregister()
to something shorter (test_obj_core_stats_dereg) has been found to
be a workaround to the issue identified in #61087.. Here is the corrected version:

	k_mutex_unlock(&test_mutex);
}

ZTEST(obj_core_stats_api, test_obj_core_stats_dereg)
{
	int  status;
	char buffer[sizeof(struct k_cycle_stats)];
