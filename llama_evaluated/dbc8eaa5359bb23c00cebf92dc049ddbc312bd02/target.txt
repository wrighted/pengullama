Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to tests: drivers: can: api: Add negative test for can_add_rx_filter(). Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

	can_remove_rx_filter(can_dev, filter_id);
}

/**
 * @brief Test adding an invalid CAN RX filter.
 *

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

	can_remove_rx_filter(can_dev, filter_id);
}

/**
 * @brief Test adding an invalid CAN RX filter.
 *
The issue was with: tests: drivers: can: api: Add negative test for can_add_rx_filter()

Check that error is reported when CAN filter is added without
callback function.. Here is the corrected version:

	can_remove_rx_filter(can_dev, filter_id);
}

/**
* @brief Test adding filter without callback.
*/
ZTEST(can_classic, test_add_filter_without_callback)
{
	int err;

	Z_TEST_SKIP_IFNDEF(CONFIG_RUNTIME_ERROR_CHECKS);

	err = can_add_rx_filter(can_dev, NULL, NULL, &test_std_filter_1);
	zassert_equal(err, -EINVAL, "added filter with NULL callback");
}
