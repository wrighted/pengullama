Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to tests: drivers: can: api: Add negative test for can_add_rx_filter(). Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

	can_remove_rx_filter(can_dev, filter_id);
}

/**
 * @brief Test adding an invalid CAN RX filter.
 *

### Response:
I think the problem is in the following line:
can_remove_rx_filter(can_dev, filter_id);
This line is trying to remove the filter before it is added. To fix this, we need to add the filter before removing it.
