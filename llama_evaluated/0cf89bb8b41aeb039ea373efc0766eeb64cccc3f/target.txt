Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to drivers/spi/spi_xlnx_axi_quadspi: Build fix w CONFIG_SPI_ASYNC. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

		 * work in the ISR, so just post the event.
		 */
#ifdef CONFIG_SPI_ASYNC
		if (ctx->asynchronous) {
			xlnx_quadspi_read_fifo(dev);
			xlnx_quadspi_start_tx(dev);

### Response:
I corrected the issue in the code you provided:

		 * work in the ISR, so just post the event.
		 */
#ifdef CONFIG_SPI_ASYNC
		if (ctx->asynchronous) {
			xlnx_quadspi_read_fifo(dev);
			xlnx_quadspi_start_tx(dev);
The issue was with: drivers/spi/spi_xlnx_axi_quadspi: Build fix w CONFIG_SPI_ASYNC

Fix a build error when CONFIG_SPI_ASYNC is set.
The issue was detected by CI

```
spi_xlnx_axi_quadspi.c: In function 'xlnx_quadspi_isr':

  489 |                 if (ctx->asynchronous) {

```. Here is the corrected version:

		 * work in the ISR, so just post the event.

#ifdef CONFIG_SPI_ASYNC
		struct spi_context *ctx = &data->ctx;

		if (ctx->asynchronous) {
			xlnx_quadspi_read_fifo(dev);
