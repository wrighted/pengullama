Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction:
I am having trouble with the following code in relation to drivers/spi/spi_xlnx_axi_quadspi: Build fix w CONFIG_SPI_ASYNC. Whats wrong? Please fix this issue.

### Input:
Here is the faulty code:

		 * work in the ISR, so just post the event.
		 */
#ifdef CONFIG_SPI_ASYNC
		if (ctx->asynchronous) {
			xlnx_quadspi_read_fifo(dev);
			xlnx_quadspi_start_tx(dev);

### Response:
The code has a few issues. Firstly, the asynchronous flag should be checked before attempting to read the fifo. Secondly, the start_tx function should be called after the fifo has been read. Lastly, the code should be updated to use the correct function calls for the asynchronous mode.
