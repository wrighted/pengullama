Below is some tokenized faulty code. Locate the error, and correct it.
### Tokenized:
Here is the faulty code which has been tokenized:

begin_empty_stmt
unit|}
empty_stmt|;
end_empty_stmt
begin_case
case|case
name|CHAN_STATE_CONFIGURED
case|:
end_case
begin_if_stmt
if|if
condition|(
name|next
operator|!=
name|CHAN_STATE_STARTED
condition|)
block|{
return|return
operator|-
name|EPERM
return|;
block|}
end_if_stmt
begin_break
break|break;
end_break

### Error location:

I have identified the issue in the tokenized code. I have placed a <START_ERROR> before the problematic tokens and a <END_ERROR> after the problematic tokens:

begin_empty_stmt
unit|}
empty_stmt|;
end_empty_stmt
begin_case
case|case
name|CHAN_STATE_CONFIGURED
case|:
end_case
begin_if_stmt
if|if
condition|(
name|next
operator|!=
name|CHAN_STATE_STARTED
condition|)
block|{
<START_ERROR>
return|return
<END_ERROR>
operator|-
name|EPERM
return|;
block|}
end_if_stmt
begin_break
break|break;
end_break

### Error correction:

Here is the tokenized code with the issue corrected:

begin_empty_stmt
unit|}
empty_stmt|;
end_empty_stmt
begin_case
case|case
name|CHAN_STATE_CONFIGURED
case|:
end_case
begin_if_stmt
if|if
condition|(
name|next
operator|!=
name|CHAN_STATE_STARTED
condition|)
block|{
return|return
operator|-
name|EINPROGRESS
return|;
block|}
end_if_stmt
begin_break
break|break;
end_break
