### Tokenized:
Here is the faulty code which has been tokenized:

begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/device.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/init.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/kernel.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<soc.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/drivers/mdio.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/net/phy.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/net/mii.h>
end_include

### Error location:
I have identified the issue in the tokenized code. I have placed a <START_ERROR> before the problematic tokens and a <END_ERROR> after the problematic tokens:

begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/device.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/init.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/kernel.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
<START_ERROR>
file|<soc.h>
<END_ERROR>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/drivers/mdio.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/net/phy.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/net/mii.h>
end_include

### Error correction:
Here is the tokenized code with the issue corrected:

begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/device.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/init.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/kernel.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/drivers/mdio.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/net/phy.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/net/mii.h>
end_include
