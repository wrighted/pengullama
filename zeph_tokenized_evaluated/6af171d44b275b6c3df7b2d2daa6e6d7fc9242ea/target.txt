### Tokenized:
Here is the faulty code which has been tokenized:

begin_comment
comment|/**
end_comment
begin_struct
struct|struct
name|net_if_ipv6_prefix
block|{
end_struct
begin_comment
comment|/**
end_comment

### Error location:
I have identified the issue in the tokenized code. I have placed a <START_ERROR> before the problematic tokens and a <END_ERROR> after the problematic tokens:

begin_comment
<END_ERROR>
comment|/**
end_comment
begin_struct
struct|struct
name|net_if_ipv6_prefix
block|{
end_struct
begin_comment
comment|/**
end_comment

### Error correction:
Here is the tokenized code with the issue corrected:

begin_comment
comment|/**
end_comment
begin_struct
struct|struct
name|net_if_ipv6_prefix
block|{
end_struct
begin_comment
comment|/**
end_comment
