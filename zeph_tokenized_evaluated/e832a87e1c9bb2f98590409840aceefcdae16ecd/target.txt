### Tokenized:
Here is the faulty code which has been tokenized:

begin_define
define|#
directive|define
name|ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_USB_HID_CLASS_DEVICE_H_
end_define
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/usb/class/hid.h>
end_include
begin_ifdef
ifdef|#
directive|ifdef
name|__cplusplus
end_ifdef
begin_extern
extern|extern
literal|"C"
block|{
end_extern

### Error location:
I have identified the issue in the tokenized code. I have placed a <START_ERROR> before the problematic tokens and a <END_ERROR> after the problematic tokens:

begin_define
define|#
directive|define
name|ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_USB_HID_CLASS_DEVICE_H_
end_define
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/usb/class/hid.h>
<END_ERROR>
end_include
<START_ERROR>
begin_ifdef
ifdef|#
directive|ifdef
name|__cplusplus
end_ifdef
begin_extern
extern|extern
literal|"C"
block|{
end_extern

### Error correction:
Here is the tokenized code with the issue corrected:

begin_define
define|#
directive|define
name|ZEPHYR_INCLUDE_USB_HID_CLASS_DEVICE_H_
end_define
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/usb/class/hid.h>
end_include
begin_include
include|#
directive|include
file|<zephyr/usb/usb_ch9.h>
end_include
begin_ifdef
ifdef|#
directive|ifdef
name|__cplusplus
end_ifdef
begin_extern
extern|extern
literal|"C"
block|{
end_extern
